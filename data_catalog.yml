  description: Contains tables with their schema defintion (column names + types) and the data
  data for these tables.
  Column names are not ready for a database (e. g. for one colum name "Years in Toronto")
  Among others, I use this file to generate
  the mapping between a column's original name and its 'clean' (e. g. slugified name)
  that can be used in a database.
  I also use this file as the basis for putting each table data into a single csv-file
