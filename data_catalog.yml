  type: jsonl
  description: Contains with their schema defintion (column names + types)+ data-.
  Column names are not ready for a database (e. g. for one colum name "Years in Toronto")
  Among others, I use this file to generate
  the mapping between a column's original name and its 'clean' (e. g. slugified name)
  that can be used in a database.
